## Goals

* Define KPI's for FMCG promo campaign via email and mobile (text, viber) channels
* Build interactive dashboards in Tableau to track number of code activations attributed to the campaign communications in total and separately for each communications channel
* Build interactive dashboards to track main performance metrics for email and mobile campaigns (Open rate, CTR, unsibsribe rate, complain rate, bounce rates etc.)
