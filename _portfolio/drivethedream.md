## Goals

* Define KPI's for online marketing communications with leads in order to increase number of requests for test-drive, quote and callback.
* Build interactive dashboard to track lead's engagement.

## Dashboard description

Every lead has it's own life-cycle stage (Prospect, AciveFirstView, Interested, Ready2Buy).

* Conversion from different Lead Stages shows the percentage of requests from lead life-cycle stage. The higher the stage, the more engaged the user.

* Conversion to request: percentage of requests for all new leads. Metric to show the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns.

* TD ratio to all requests: frequency of requests for test-drive to total number of requests. Test-drive requests strategically have more value for the company as conversion to purchase from handovered test-drives is much higher in comparison to other types of requests.

* Conversion to purchase: conversion to purchase for different types of requests.

* Leads by stage funnel: an overview of the number of leads at each leads life-cycle stage.
